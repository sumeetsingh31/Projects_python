<h1>Snake, Water, Gun Game</h1>
This is a simple Python-based game where the player competes against the computer (CPU). It is similar to the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

How to Play:
The player chooses between three options: Snake, Water, or Gun.
The computer also randomly chooses one of the three options.
The rules are:
Snake drinks Water (Snake wins).
Gun shoots Snake (Gun wins).
Water douses Gun (Water wins).
If both the player and the computer choose the same option, the game is a tie.
If the player's option defeats the computer's, the player wins!
Game Rules:
Snake < Gun < Water < Snake.
Good luck and have fun!
